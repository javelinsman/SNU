#### Attention

* texting while driving
* attention is complex
    * divied attention, secondary tasks
    * talking while typing vs. talking while walking
        * some tasks require attention while others not very much
        * differs by person
    * what are human limits?
* two categories of attention
    * divided attention
        * attending to more than one
    * selected attention

#### human error

* simple view : discrete event were the oucome deviated from the desired outcome
* human error can be studied in many levels
    * some serious while others not
* variability and error
    * 특정한 metric을 정하기도 해
    * mouse tracking 등

#### accidents

* a broader perspective necessary
* serious accidents often attributes to human error
* fault may be a design induced error
* interaction error are likely to anticipated in design process


## Homework #1

* find a disaster or accident caused by design flaw or human error in using the design
* describe the disaster or the accident explain how the flaw or the error affected the problem
* 수업 내용 들어가면 더 좋대
* suggest an alternative design and explain why it is better
* 2~3 pages with figures
* 표절에 매우 깐깐하니 citation 잘하세요
* by April 6

## Term project

* declare you term project idea by April 13
* project partners
* implementation is mandatory for term project
    * analysis -> design -> implementation -> evaluation
* 매우매우매우 신박한 아이디어가 아닌 이상 implemantation은 1달 분량정도
    * 좀 큰 걸 만들라는 말

#### human information processor(model human processor)

* unified model
    * several aspects of cog psy into a unified picture
    * recognize-act cycle
    * simplified model
* intended audience :CS
* predicting human behavior
    * human performance while using the computer
    * 뭔가 숫자로 말해준대
* human mind as an information processing system
    * with memory decaying
* practical and influention
    * even if it is very simplified model

#### subsystems of HIP(or MHP)

* 3 system with memory and processor each
    * memory
        * capacity
        * **decay time**
        * code type(physical, acoustic, visual, semantic)
    * processor
        * cycle time
* perceptual system
    * sensors and memories(visual & auditory image store)
    * symbolically codes the output of the sensory system
* cognitive system
    * receives symbolically coded info from working memory
    * matches info in long term memory
    * make decision about how to respond
* motor system
    * carries out response

#### example : simple reaction time

* perceptual processor cycle (T_P)
    1. see \alpha on screen
    1. coded representation in the visual image store (\alpha.)
        * physical properties
    1. visually coded symbl in working memory (\alpha..)
* cognitive processor cycle (T_C)
    * occurence of the stimulus is connected with a response
    * task requirement is stored in LTM <- ?
* motor processor sycle (T_M)
    * carry out physical movement

#### perceptual system - eye

* central vision
    * fovea
    * 2 degrees across
    * detail obtained
* peripheral vision
    * retina
    * orientation
    * intensity
* head movement
    * if > 30deg away from fovea
    * then people move the head

#### perceptual processor

* from physical perception to abstract concept
    * color, shape, orientation, brightness, movement to "B" or "Circle"
* coded for transfer to working memory
    * progressive decoding : 10ms/letter
        * 차례대로 하나하나 보는 것
    * selective decoding : spatial, pre-attentive(color, direction, ...)
        * 내가 보고싶은 것만 보는 것
        * ex. how many 3.s? salient features
        * pre-attentive tasks
            * attention 거의 안 사용
            * 250ms 이내에 수행가능
            * single glance
            * target detection 등에 사용
            * example of variables
                    * orientation
                    * curved/straight
                    * shape
                    * size
                    * number
                    * gray/value
                    * enclosure
                    * convexity/concavity
    * capacity : 7~17 letter (without chunks and not considering retrieval)
* decay : 200ms
    * half-life(half-time) : time after which prob. of retrieval < .5
