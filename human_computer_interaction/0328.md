#### Attention

* texting while driving
* attention is complex
    * divied attention, secondary tasks

        * differs by person
    * what are human limits?
* two categories of attention
    * divided attention
        * attending to more than one

#### human error

* simple view : discrete event were the oucome deviated from the desired outcome
* human error can be studied in many levels
    * some serious while others not
* variability and error

#### accidents

* a broader perspective necessary
* serious accidents often attributes to human error
* fault may be a design induced error
* interaction error are likely to anticipated in design process

* 3 system with memory and processor each
    * memory
        * capacity
        * **decay time**
        * code type(physical, acoustic, visual, semantic)
    * processor
        * cycle time
* perceptual system
    * sensors and memories(visual & auditory image store)
    * symbolically codes the output of the sensory system
* cognitive system
    * receives symbolically coded info from working memory
    * matches info in long term memory
    * make decision about how to respond
* motor system
    * carries out response
* MHP의 parameter가 모든 사람한테 딱딱 들어맞는 게 아니니까 (uncertain)
    * 3 가지 버전을 만듬
    * middleman [slowman ~ fastman]

#### example : simple reaction time

* perceptual processor cycle (T_P)
    1. see \alpha on screen
    1. coded representation in the visual image store (\alpha.)
        * physical properties
    1. visually coded symbl in working memory (\alpha..)
* cognitive processor cycle (T_C)
    * occurence of the stimulus is connected with a response
    * task requirement is stored in LTM <- ?
* motor processor sycle (T_M)
    * carry out physical movement

#### perceptual system - eye

* central vision
    * fovea
    * 2 degrees across
    * detail obtained
* peripheral vision
    * retina
    * orientation
    * intensity
* head movement
    * if > 30deg away from fovea
    * then people move the head

#### perceptual processor

* from physical perception to abstract concept
    * color, shape, orientation, brightness, movement to "B" or "Circle"
* coded for transfer to working memory
    * progressive decoding : 10ms/letter
        * 차례대로 하나하나 보는 것
    * selective decoding : spatial, pre-attentive(color, direction, ...)
        * 내가 보고싶은 것만 보는 것
        * ex. how many 3.s? salient features
        * pre-attentive tasks
            * attention 거의 안 사용
            * 250ms 이내에 수행가능
            * single glance
            * target detection 등에 사용
            * example of variables
                    * orientation
                    * curved/straight
                    * shape
                    * size
                    * number
                    * gray/value
                    * enclosure
                    * convexity/concavity
    * capacity : 7~17 letter (without chunks and not considering retrieval)
        * 이런 수치 대강이나마 알고 있어야
* decay : 200ms
    * half-life(half-time) : time after which prob. of retrieval < .5
    * 50ms 자극 주고 언제까지 기억하나 보면
    * 실험 조건에 따라서 (9 letters, 621 msec), (12, 215), (16, 92) -> 평균 내면 대충 200ms
    * 인터페이스 설계할 때도 200ms보다 오래 사람들에게 기억시키지 말아야 함
* cycle time : unit impuls response
    * 소리 들려주고 몇 펄스 들었니?
    * 30/sec => 거의 절반, 15/sec 75퍼정도? 10/sec쯤 되어야 정확하게 듣는다
    * 책 정의 : time response of the visual system to a very brief pulse of light
    * quantum experience
        * 더 이상 쪼갤 수 없는 경험
        * 100ms, [50~200]
        * 넘 빠르면 perceptual fusion이 일어남
            * two stimuli within a perceptual processor cycle appear fused
        * perceptual causality
            * the first event appears to cause the other
            * immediate causality
                * 이걸 사람들이 느껴야 하는데 좀만 더 늦어지면 밑의 단계로 간다
            * delayed causality
            * independent causality
    * Bloch.s Law(1885) : I*t = k, t < cycle time
        * I : intensity of stimulus
        * t : lasting time of stimulus
    * ex. moving picture rate
